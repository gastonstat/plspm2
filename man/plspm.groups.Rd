\usage{
  plspm.groups(pls, group, Y = NULL, method = "bootstrap",
    reps = NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{pls}{object of class \code{"plspm"}}

  \item{group}{factor with 2 levels indicating the groups
  to be compared}

  \item{Y}{optional dataset (matrix or data frame) used
  when argument \code{dataset=NULL} inside \code{pls}.}

  \item{method}{method to be used in the test. Possible
  values are \code{"bootstrap"} or \code{"permutation"}}

  \item{reps}{integer indicating the number of either
  bootstrap resamples or number of permutations. If
  \code{NULL} then \code{reps}=100}
}
\value{
  An object of class \code{"plspm.groups"}

  \item{test}{Table with the results of the applied test.
  Includes: path coefficients of the global model, path
  coeffs of group1, path coeffs of group2, (absolute)
  difference of path coeffs between groups, and the test
  results with the p-value.}

  \item{global}{List with inner model results for the
  global model}

  \item{group1}{List with inner model results for group1}

  \item{group2}{List with inner model results for group2}
}
\description{
  Performs a group comparison test for comparing path
  coefficients between two groups. The null and alternative
  hypotheses to be tested are: H0: path coefficients are
  not significantly different; H1: path coefficients are
  significantly different
}
\details{
  \code{plspm.groups} performs a two groups comparison test
  in PLS-PM for comparing path coefficients between two
  groups. Only two methods are available: 1) bootstrap, and
  2) permutation. The bootstrap test is an adapted t-test
  based on bootstrap standard errors. The permutation test
  is a randomization test which provides a non-parametric
  option.

  When the object \code{pls} does not contain a data matrix
  (i.e. \code{pls$data=NULL}), the user must provide the
  data matrix or data frame in \code{Y}.

 ## example with customer satisfaction analysis
 ## group comparison based on the segmentation variable "gender"

 # load data satisfaction

 # define outer model list

 # define vector of reflective modes

 # apply plspm

 # permutation test with 100 permutations
